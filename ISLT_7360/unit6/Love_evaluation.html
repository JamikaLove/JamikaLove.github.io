        <h1>Jamika Love-Logan's Evaluation Report</h1>
        <h2>Participants</h2>
        <p>Michelle is a parent of 2 high school students, and she is also a fellow educator who currently teaches preschool.Her daughter will be a senior this year, and she has been asking many questions about testing and where to locate scholarships.I asked her to review the site in terms of the design and content. Michelle used a Dell intel core i5 with Windows 7 and 5GB of Ram for this review. She used a wireless home connection.</p>
        <p>Amy is a school counselor in my district. She works for a different high school, and has some experience with updating her own school website.From a counselor standpoint she knows what information is needed to run a successful counseling website. I asked her to identify any missing information from her perspective.I asked Amy to review design, content and credibility. Amy used an HP laptop with Windows 10 with an i5 processor and 4GB of RAM. She used a wireless connection from a coffee shop.</p>
        <p>Jada is one of my students who is a high school senior. She is very proactive about researching information about her post-secondary plans. At the moment she is torn between going to the military and going to a four year university. I asked Jada to right down what she would like to see in a website, prior to reviewing mine. I also asker her to review design and content. Jada used an Apple MacBook Air with an i5 processor and 8GB of memory. She used a wireless connection from home.</p>
        <h2>Evaluators' Comments</h2>
        <table style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                  <th>Category</th>

                </tr>
              </table>
        <p>All users agreed that the color scheme was a little distracting or a bit much. Jada thought that I should use a white background with highlights of the school colors. Amy thought that the navigation links should be seperated a bit more to align with the page, and she also suggested using a different color for the navigation links.All agreed that the navigation was easy to follow however.</p>
        <p>All users agreed that the content was appropriate for the intended audience. Amy suggested adding a page geared towards explaining the college application process. Jada was excited to see the list of scholarships but understands that the list may be limited at the moment since it is summertime. Michelle appreciated the video explaining FAFSA. </p>
        <h2>Evaluator Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://JamikaLove.github.io/ISLT_7360/unit6/michelleeval.docx">Michelle's Evaluation</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://JamikaLove.github.io/ISLT_7360/unit6/amyeval.docx">Amy's Evaluation</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://JamikaLove.github.io/ISLT_7360/unit6/jadaeval.docx">Jada's Evaluation</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p> My three use cases included the finding of scholarships, testing dates and deadlines, and parents looking for information on the college application/financial aid process. Based on the evaluations, the content intended for my website is appropriate, however, Amy did suggest that I add a page for the college application process.  I do not currently have a page for this. Also the scholarship  page is not complete with a list of scholarships, as Jada pointed out. I do not want to abandon the scholarship page, but I do want the information to be thorough and accurate, so I will continue to work hard to find scholarships for this upcoming fall.</p>
        <h2>Recommended Changes</h2>
        <p>Based on the feedback I have received, I plan on making the following changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Design/Navigation</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I will try to tone the colors down. I haven't decided exactly how I will do it yet, but I will try to make it so the school colors are an accent to the page.</li>
                <li> I will space out the navigation links,so that it looks more symmetrical.</li>
                <li> I will change the color of the navigation hyperlinks so that it complements the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Content</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I will add a page with college tips and possibly a video explaining the college application process.</li>
                <li>I will continue to add to the scholarship list by finding scholarships with August/Septem deadline. However, in my experience as a counselor, many of the deadlines are in late October and November, so many scholarships may not be posted yet.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </ul>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>The evaluation process has been an eye-opening experience for me. The surveys are good for quantitative data, but I find the interviews expanding on the survey to be the most effective. I definitely benefitted from the evaluation process, because I didn't realize how everyone perceives things differently. For example, the color/scheme didn't really stand out to me, but it was interesting to see how it made the users feel. Because web development is new to me, I can sometimes get discouraged in my design approach. However getting the suggestions of the different users forces me to continue to develop the page and figure things out, such as how to space out the navigation links or add the colors as a border rather than use the colors on the entire page. It is a challenging process and helps me to develop my skills. Each of my evaluators represented a different role, but they are all significant to this project because they represent the people that will spend a lot of time looking at my webpage. I am pleased with the evaluation process and I am hopeful that it will assist me with completing my final webpage.</p>
