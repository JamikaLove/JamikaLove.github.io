<h2>Interview Questions</h2>
<p>I sent interview questions to a mix of parents, students, and one counselor</p>
<ul>
    <li>What would you find useful on a high school counseling website for seniors?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Scholarship information</li>
        <li>ACT and SAT Registration information</li>
        <li>Tips on applying to college</li>
    </ul>
    <li>How often would you vist a school counseling website specific to your school?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Once a week if the information was updated frequently.</li>
        <li>Once or twice a week</li>
        <li>A few times a month</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Is there anything that would discourage you from visiting the site?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Infreqent updating</li>
        <li>Irrelevant information that doesn't pertain to high school seniors</li>
        <li>Difficult to read or hard to follow</li>
        <li>As long as the information was useful, I would continue to use the site.</li>
    </ul>

 </ul>

</ul>
<h2> Purpose</h2>
<p>This website is intended for students and parents of graduating seniors to gather information that will assist them with their transition from high school to college/military/career. The purpose of this website will be to provide information on upcoming events deadlines, financial aid and other post-secondary tips. In addition to pertinent information, students and parents will be able to fill out a checklist to monitor where they are in the process.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Students and/or parents looking for a list of scholarships</li>
    <li>Students and/or parents looking for testing dates and deadlines</li>
    <li>Parents who wish to assist their student with the college application process but are unsure of where to start</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<ol>
    <h3><li>Audience</li></h3>
    <p>The target audience for this website will be Soldan high school seniors and their parents.The students all have computer access at school. Not all students have internet access in their homes, but they are aware of computer resources.Most of the students access the internet on thier mobile devices.</p>
    <h3><li>Reference Websites</li></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an example of a website I do not want. There seems to be no overall structure. For example, there are a couple of different tabs one can click on for scholarships. I would like for my page to be organized and users should be able to find one particular topic in one place. <a href= "http://hayshighschoolcounseling.weebly.com/">Hays High School Website</a></li>
        <li>I like the navigation menu of this website. It is simple and clean and seems better at the top rather than on the sides.<a href= "http://cfhsschoolcounseling.weebly.com/ ">CFHS School Counseling</a> </li>
        <li>The overall layout of this website is similar to how I want my layout. It is simple but not boring, and the title font has a trendy look. <a href= "https://sites.google.com/a/kirksville.k12.mo.us/kirksville-high-school-guidance-and-counseling-webpage/">Kirksville High School</a></li>
        <li>I really like the graphics and media used on this page. This is also very similar to the graphics I will use.<a href= "https://www.polytechpanthers.com/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=170409&type=d">Polytech Panthers</a> </li>
        <li>This website seems really cluttered with too many tabs at the top. I want to avoid this type of layout. <a href= "https://sites.google.com/site/libertyhighcounseling/">Liberty High School</a></li>
    </ul>
</ol>

    <h3><li>Rationale for Organization</li></h3>
    <p> I am aiming to provide simplicity for my audience being careful not to overwhelm them with clutter, but also providing them with all of the content needed.</p>
    <h3><li>Media</li></h3>
    <p>For this website, I plan to use images of the school mascot, as well as an image of myself. I will also incorporate a youtube video with instructions on how to complete the FAFSA</p>
    <h3><li>Color Scheme</li></h3>
    <p>I would like for my page to express school spirit. Therfore I will use the school colors of maroon and gold. The text will be black, so that it is not hard to read on the gold background. The headers will be maroon, however.</p>
